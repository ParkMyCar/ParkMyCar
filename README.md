I'm Parker, a software engineer who enjoys Rust and building high performance systems.


I work at [Materialize](https://materialize.com/) where we're building an operational data store.
For folks who know SQL, we provide incrementally maintained materialized views! If this sounds interesting,
I've [talked ðŸŽ¥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAtAA6BE0YE) about how we built it.

I'm also a co-organizer of the [RustNYC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rust-nyc/), we meet the second Tuesday of every month!
